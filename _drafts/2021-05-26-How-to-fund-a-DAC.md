The following is the perspective of an engineer that has been in the space for
some time and learned a few lessons from success and failure of other
blockchain launches. Of course, the following requires proper legal review and
might not be fit for purpose just yet.

# Funding a Distributed Autonomous Company

As with regular companies, funding is required to pay for expenses of growth.
In particular in the startup phase, cash (or cash equivalent) funding is
important in order for a business to get off the ground, produce revenue and
eventually generate a profit.

There are similarities and differences when comparing with a distributed
autonomous company (DAC). Similarities are:

* existence of *shareholders* (tokenholders)
* providing of (digital) services for a fee
* operational expenses for maintaining the underlying blockchain
* profit sharing with shareholders
* governance structure

As for the differences compare to regular companies, we have:

* non-existence of a CEO
* unclear jurisdictional responsibilities
* uncertain regulatory waters
* unclear liabilities

Obviously, we won't solve the problems that come with those differences in a
simple blog post. However, what we can achieve with blockchain technologies is
transparency as well as checks and balances within the governance structure.

## Goals

## Constraints
* Legally sound setup
* 

## Challenges
* What services can a DAC earn revenue on?
