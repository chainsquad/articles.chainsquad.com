Today, after a long process of decision making, I came to the conclusion that
it would be beneficial to start some sort of "blog" where I can aggregate
technical thoughts, discoveries.

## Beneficial? How so?

How is writing supposed to be beneficial and - to whom?

<blockquote>
Writing might be beneficial to cognitive skills because it requires focusing
of attention, planning and forethought, organization of one's thinking, and
reflective thought, among other abilities â€“ thereby sharpening these skills
through practice and reinforcement.

This might lead to personal growth but it also helps with:

1. Making communications clearer
2. Eliminating stress
3. Becoming more productive
4. Learning more
5. Gaining awareness of reality
6. Improve decision making
7. Become happier
8. Live more focused
9. Overcome thought moments faster
10. Obtain track record

## So, what's to expect

Given that this is all hosted on a for-profit commercial site, the purpose of
this site is to provide insights into progress this company makes, lessons
learned along the way and establish a library of knowledge for us and the
public.
